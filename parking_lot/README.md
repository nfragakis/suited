## Problem Statement
Design a parking lot. You can assume the following:
- The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars, and vans
- The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and regular spots
- A motorcycle can park in any spot, a car can park in either a compact or regular
spot, and a van takes up 3 regular spots

There should be an API that allows the user to do the following at any given time:
- Tell us how many spots are remaining
- Tell us how many total spots there are in the lot
- Tell us if the parking lot is full/empty
- Tell how many spots are remaining for a given car type
- Tell us how many spots vans take up

Note: This is an intentionally vague exercise, and you will have to make a number of assumptions along the way. Please include the following:

- a) Your code that would create the API above (both underlying code and the api code) 
- b) Any extra assumptions you madeand their impacts to the code or the code design 
- c) How you would push the code from a) to a production environment
